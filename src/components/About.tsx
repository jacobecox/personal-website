          <p>
            I&apos;m a full stack software engineer with a love for solving
            real problems in ways that genuinely make life better for others.
            Whether it&apos;s building a web app from scratch or designing
            cloud architecture that scales, I enjoy working across the entire
            stack to bring ideas to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m always dabbling in new technologies — picking up a new
            framework, experimenting with a different cloud provider, or diving
            into a tool I haven&apos;t tried before. That curiosity keeps me
            sharp and makes me a better engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, what drives me is the impact. I want to
            build things that matter — software that helps people, simplifies
            their work, or gives them something they didn&apos;t have before.
