          <p>
            I&apos;m a software developer with a passion for building
            thoughtful, well-crafted applications. I enjoy working across the
            full stack but have a particular focus on front-end development and
            creating great user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not writing code, you&apos;ll find me exploring new
            technologies, contributing to open source, or working on side
            projects that scratch a creative itch.
          </p>
          <p>
            I value clean architecture, readable code, and pragmatic solutions
            that get the job done without over-engineering.
          </p>
